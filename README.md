# Data Exploration and analysis with pandas on US Bikeshare Data.
***An investigation of US bikeshare data using Python and pandas***.

#Project Overview
This project focuses on using the pandas library and basic statistical techniques to do descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from Chicago, Washington, and New York City, three major U.S. cities, in order to display data such as the most popular days or stations.
#Running the program
To run this program, enter 'python bikeshare.py' into your terminal. On a Windows 10 PC, I utilise Anaconda's command prompt.
