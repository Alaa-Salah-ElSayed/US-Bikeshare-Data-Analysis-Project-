# Data Exploration and analysis with pandas on US Bikeshare Data.
***An investigation of US bikeshare data using Python and pandas***.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on using the pandas library and basic statistical techniques to do descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from Chicago, Washington, and New York City, three major U.S. cities, in order to display data such as the most popular days or stations.
# Running the program
To run this program, enter 'python bikeshare.py' into your terminal. On a Windows 10 PC, I utilise Anaconda's command prompt.
# Program Details
The application requires user input for the city (e.g., Chicago), month for which data is desired (e.g., January; also provides a 'all' option), and day for which data is desired (e.g., Monday; also includes a 'all' option).

After receiving user input, it proceeds to ask the user whether they want to examine the raw data (5 rows of data at first) or not. Following the input, the application prints the following information:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)
Finally, the user is given the option of resuming the program or not.
